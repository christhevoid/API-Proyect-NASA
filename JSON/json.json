Around 11 p.m. local time, June 6, an explosion from this volcano, for which the summit elevation is approximately 3,850 meters,  produced an ash plume to a height of approximately 8.5 kilometers (27,900 feet). The ash plume traveled southwest at a speed of approximately 79 kilometers per hour, and ash fell in and around the cities of Colima, about 30 kilometers away, and Villa de Alvarez.  Brief evacuation of some 50 residents in the area was considered a minor undertaking and it was reported some three days after this picture was taken that all were able to return to their homes."

Around 11 p.m. local time, June 6, an explosion from this volcano, for which the summit elevation is approximately 3,850 meters,  produced an ash plume to a height of approximately 8.5 kilometers (27,900 feet). The ash plume traveled southwest at a speed of approximately 79 kilometers per hour, and ash fell in and around the cities of Colima, about 30 kilometers away, and Villa de Alvarez.  Brief evacuation of some 50 residents in the area was considered a minor undertaking and it was reported some three days after this picture was taken that all were able to return to their homes."

Using NASA's Scout impact hazard assessment system, members of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) – which is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California – accurately predicted where and when the asteroid would harmlessly break up in Earth's atmosphere. Infrasound sensors, which can detect low frequency sound waves as they travel through the atmosphere, confirmed the impact occurred over the Norwegian Sea, southwest of Norway's Jan Mayen island.

The city is located on the Angara River. The central downtown area of the city is depicted in this photograph, as well as the Akademgorodok district around the State University (left of image along the southern bank of the Angara River). The oblique (non-vertical) look angle of this image imparts a three dimension perspective to the scene that accentuates the blockiness of Soviet-era building projects to the east of the downtown area. The Irkutsk Dam (center), built for the generation of hydroelectric power, dramatically widened the river and drowned several stream outlet channels along the north and south banks. The Angara River is the only outlet from Lake Baikal to the southeast, and impoundment of water behind the dam has raised the lake level by 6 meters (20 ft)."

The city of Las Cruces is located within the Rio Grande Rift, a large geological feature that extends from Colorado southward into Mexico. According to NASA geologists, rifting usually heralds the breakup of continental landmasses, such as the separation of South America and Africa to form the southern Atlantic Ocean during the Mesozoic Era. The Rift is marked by a series of depressions (known as graben) caused by the subsidence of crustal blocks between parallel faults as the continental crust is pulled apart by tectonic forces. These graben are frequently marked by uplifted rocks along bounding faults &#0151; the striking Organ Mountains to the east of Las Cruces are one such uplifted fault block. While separation of the continental crust is no longer occurring, the Rio Grande Rift is still considered active as evidenced by frequent low-intensity earthquakes and hot springs to the north of Las Cruces. The modern city of Las Cruces &#0151; the seat of Do&#0241;a Ana County and home to New Mexico State University &#0151; is undergoing rapid urban expansion due to influx of new residents attracted to the climate and landscape. The current urban area (gray to white region at image center) contrasts sharply with agricultural lands (dark green and grey brown) located along the Rio Grande River and the surrounding desert valley floor to the northeast and southwest (brown, blue gray and tan areas)."

Located in the Sudirman Mountains of the Irian Jaya province of Indonesia, the Grasberg complex (also known as the Freeport Mine) is one of the largest gold and copper mining operations in the world. The Sudirman Mountains form the western portion of the Maoke Range that extend across Irian Jaya from west to the east-southeast. According to scientists, these ranges were formed by ongoing collision of the northward-moving Australian and westward-moving Pacific tectonic plates. Intrusion of hot magma into sedimentary rock layers during uplift of the mountains resulted in the formation of copper- and gold-bearing ore bodies. Rich copper ore bodies were discovered in the area in 1936, and the Grasberg gold-bearing ore bodies were discovered in 1988. This image illustrates the approximately 4 kilometers-wide open-pit portion of the mine complex; there are also extensive underground mine workings. Access roads for trucks hauling ore and waste rock are visible along the sides of the pit."

There is no permanent human base on South Georgia Island, a British territory in the South Atlantic Ocean that lies 1300 kilometers east of the Falkland Islands. Using a long lens (800 mm focal length) and positioned for an oblique view, the crew of the international space station was able to capture the rugged and isolated landscape of the northern shore of the island. The high mountains protect the north and eastern coast of the island from the prevailing gales coming from Antarctica and the west. The steep topography also makes deep embayments along the coast that provide habitat for wildlife and anchorages for whaling ships. The island supports major rookeries of penguins and albatrosses, and large seal populations. This view centers on Mt. Paget and Cumberland Bay. The former whaling station Grytviken is located within the bay. The encampment supports the scientific base for the British Antarctic Survey and Bird Island Research Station."

Searles Lake is known for the abundance of rare elements and evaporite minerals, such as trona, hanksite, and halite formed within its sediments. These minerals dissolve in water or very humid environments. According to NASA scientists who are studying the Space Station photography, during the Pleistocene Epoch (beginning approximately two million years ago), Searles Lake was one of a chain of lakes fed by streamflow from the Sierra Nevada to the west. Lake levels rose and fell dependant on glacial outwash from the Sierra Nevada as climates shifted. Successive layers of sediment were deposited as lake levels fluctuated, preserving an important record of regional climate change. The lakes gradually dried up completely as climatic conditions became hotter and drier (as today), forming a string of enclosed basins with no outlets (playas). This photograph depicts the Searles Lake playa (characterized by white surface mineral deposits) bounded by the Argus and Slate Mountains. The width of the playa is approximately 10 kilometers. The center of the image is dominated by mining operations that extract sodium- and potassium-rich minerals (primarily borax and salt) for industrial use. Minerals are primarily in naturally-occurring brines that are pumped to the surface and evaporated to crystallize the minerals. A large evaporation pond (black) is visible in the center of the image. Further processing concentrates the minerals and removes excess water."

The rough boundary between Europe and Asia is defined by the Ural River and the Ural Mountains to its north. The Ural River flows to the great inland Caspian Sea, and gives its name to the major city of Uralsk (population approximately 250,000) on its banks. Lying just inside the Kazakh border with Russia, Uralsk is an agricultural and industrial center, and important trade stop since the early 1600s. Barge traffic has passed up and down the Ural River between the Caspian Sea and the Ural Mountains for centuries. Today it is one of the major entry points for rail traffic from Europe to Siberia, servicing the many new oil fields in the Caspian basin and the industrial cities of the southern Urals. Numerous details are visible in the photo, including the city margin, city blocks and even the causeway and individual buildings. Part of the smaller sister city of Zashaghan can be seen on the opposite bank (bottom). The green vegetated parts of the floodplains and black inundated parts (lower left, bottom image) stand out clearly. The brown Ural River waters contrast with the darker color of its tributary, the Chogan River (lower image)."

Etosha Pan, northern Namibia, is a large (120 kilometers or 75 mile long) dry lakebed in the Kalahari Desert. The lake and surrounds are protected today as one of Namibia&#0146;s largest wildlife parks. Herds of elephants occupy the dense mopane woodland on the south side of the lake. Mopane trees are common throughout south-central Africa, and host the mopane worm (the larval form of the Mopane Emperor Moth)&#0150;an important source of protein for rural communities. According to scientists, about 16,000 years ago, when ice sheets were melting across Northern Hemisphere land masses, a wet climate phase in southern Africa filled Etosha Lake. Today, Etosha Pan is seldom seen with even a thin sheet of water covering the salt pan. Typically, little river water or sediment reaches the dry lake because water seeps into the riverbed along its 250 kilometers (155 miles) course, reducing discharge along the way."

The station crewmember took advantage of cloud free skies and the powerful 800 mm lens to photograph this peak, fully 800 miles to the north of the spacecraft, which was located over the Gulf of Alaska. The powerful lenses are difficult to use, requiring motion compensation by the astronaut, so that these kinds of detailed images of horizon detail are seldom taken. The rising sun casts long shadows across the Kahiltna Glacier that angles down from Mt. McKinley (lower left). Other glaciers with moraine lines appear at far left and far right. Despite the blueness inherent in images taken at great distance, this image also shows unusually dense atmospheric haze at lower altitudes: all the valleys in the foreground appear murky due to forest fire smoke."

There is no permanent human base on South Georgia Island, a British territory in the South Atlantic Ocean that lies 1300 kilometers east of the Falkland Islands. Using a long lens (800 mm focal length) and positioned for an oblique view, the crew of the international space station was able to capture the rugged and isolated landscape of the northern shore of the island. The high mountains protect the north and eastern coast of the island from the prevailing gales coming from Antarctica and the west. The steep topography also makes deep embayments along the coast that provide habitat for wildlife and anchorages for whaling ships. The island supports major rookeries of penguins and albatrosses, and large seal populations. This view centers on Mt. Paget and Cumberland Bay. The former whaling station Grytviken is located within the bay. The encampment supports the scientific base for the British Antarctic Survey and Bird Island Research Station."
